The repo contains a few example receipts but you can upload any of your own. The model was originally used for my previous startups sustainability analysis app and is optimized for German supermarkets. I've included an English version. Simply change line 13 in routes.py to `results = analyze_receipt_en(file)`. The English version contains capitalization mistakes and is based on a google translation of my German Dataset, use with caution.
